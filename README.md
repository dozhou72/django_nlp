django nlp project
The project aims to build a Django app to predict NLP from user input.
1.	We want to build an app to identify the POS tags of the user input.
2.	With this interface, develop and train a model to classify the different sentiments of a document.
3.	Finally, take information from a user and return a pos tags summary and sentiment prediction.
Major challenges: 
1.	Python Web Development-Django:
2.	Setting up python virtual environment-venv:
3.	NLP tools- IBM Watson and Text Razor
4.	Visual Studio code:
Data: Stanford ACL Imdb V1 dataset
NLP Function: 
1.	To identify the POS tags of the user input.
2.	To develop and train a model to classify the different sentiments of each review.
User interaction:
1.	Allow users to input their own document for pos tags and sentiment analysis.
2.	Allow users to select different approaches for the above analysis.
